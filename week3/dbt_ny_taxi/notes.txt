IMP Files:
1. dbt_project.yml
    - declare profile name
    - specify model structure and types
    - few more things regarding project

2. profiles.yml (in home dir):
    - Specify database credentials. Keep them seperate as dev and prd

3. schema.yml (inside model dir)
    - Specify sources from where data should be pulled

4. Macro
    - Similar to UDF functions like other programming languages.
    - Difference is UDF returns the result of computatitons, but macro in DBT returns the "code" itself.
    - Use to avoid repeatitive code and code readability.
    - Use exact same way config & source using jinja template.
    - While passing parameters in macro, always use '' quotes.

5. To run specific model use,
    - dbt run -m <model_name>
    - dbt run --select <model_name>

6. packages.yml
    - To use macro, models of different DBT project into our project, 
        we have to put those dependencies in packages.yml file.
    - To installed those dependencies run this command,
        
        dbt deps

    - It will download those packages in our project under dbt_packages(hidden).
